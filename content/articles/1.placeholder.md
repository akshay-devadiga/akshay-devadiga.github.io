description: Canonical URLs play a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO) by indicating the preferred version of a web page to index. This is particularly important for content management systems and dynamic websites where multiple URLs might lead to the same content. In Nuxt.js, a powerful framework based on Vue.js, setting up canonical URLs can be efficiently achieved using layouts. In this article, we'll explore how to implement canonical URLs in a Nuxt.js project using layouts.

        - name: "keywords"
          content: "Raspberry Pi 5, Large Language Models, LLMs, TinyLlama, TinyLlama 1.1B Model"

## Understanding Canonical URLs

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly understand what canonical URLs are and why they are important.

A canonical URL is the preferred version of a webpage when there are multiple URLs that lead to the same content. Search engines use canonical URLs to determine the original source of content, thus avoiding duplicate content issues and consolidating ranking signals to a single URL.

For instance, if you have a webpage accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS or through different URL variations (with or without trailing slashes), specifying a canonical URL ensures that search engines index only the preferred version.

## Implementing Canonical URLs with Nuxt.js Layouts

Nuxt.js provides a convenient way to set up layouts, which act as templates for your pages. By leveraging layouts, we can implement canonical URLs across multiple pages with ease.

### Step 1: Create a Layout

Firstly, create a layout file if you haven't already. Layouts are stored in the `layouts` directory of your Nuxt.js project. Here's a basic example:

```html
<!-- layouts/default.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your layout structure here -->
    <Nuxt />
  </div>
</template>
```

### Step 2: Define the Canonical URL
Next, within your layout file, you can dynamically set the canonical URL based on the current route. Nuxt.js provides access to route metadata via the $route object. Here's how you can define the canonical URL meta tag within your layout:
```html
Copy code
<!-- layouts/default.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your layout structure here -->
    <Nuxt />
    <head>
      <link rel="canonical" :href="canonicalUrl" />
    </head>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    canonicalUrl() {
      return process.client ? window.location.href : '';
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
In this example, we're dynamically setting the href attribute of the canonical link tag based on the current URL. The process.client condition ensures that this code runs only on the client side to access the window location.

### Step 3: Apply the Layout
Finally, apply this layout to your pages. By default, Nuxt.js uses the default.vue layout for all pages. If you wish to use a different layout for specific pages, you can specify it in the page component:
```html
Copy code
<!-- pages/example-page.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your page content here -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  layout: 'default' // Use the default layout
}
</script>
```
### Conclusion
In this article, we've explored how to set up canonical URLs in a Nuxt.js project using layouts. By dynamically defining the canonical URL within the layout file, we ensure that it applies to all pages in our application. This not only helps in improving SEO but also ensures a consistent and preferred URL version for our content. Integrating canonical URLs into your Nuxt.js project is a simple yet effective way to optimize your website for search engines and improve overall discoverability.
